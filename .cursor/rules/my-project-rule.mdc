- use yarn whenever possible
- Always execute `codebase_search` in `/Users/easonj/CursorProject/CashCat` **before** creating or modifying any files. If no relevant results are found, verify manually before proceeding.
- please don't restart the servers, as most of time it is already running. Do refreshment on the broswer in debugger mode and check the logs, etc.
